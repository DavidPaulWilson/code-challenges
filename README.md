# code-challenges
My solutions to simple coding problems, ranging from HackerRank challenges to common interview questions.

This repository contains my proposed solutions to a variety of coding exercises. Solutions for many of these problems are already available freely on the Internet, so I do not expect to impress with my ability to solve them. Instead, my goal with this repository is to demonstrate my structure, documentation, and prioritization in coding.

Unless otherwise noted, my aim in any project is to produce functionally efficient, readable code one can return to at a future date with minimal trouble. This often means my solutions appear longer and more verbose than necessary, but I believe visual clarity and thorough commenting is important.

Thank you for reading.
